# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` that occurs when attempting to access an array element outside of its declared bounds.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that produces this error. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to avoid the error using proper bounds checking.

This example highlights the importance of careful array index handling in Ada to prevent runtime exceptions.
